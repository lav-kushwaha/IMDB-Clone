**IMDB CLONE MOVIE WEBSITE**

I successfully developed an IMDB Clone Movie Website using React.js, leveraging the TMDB API for dynamic movie data. The website features a user-friendly interface with Movie Cards and a detailed Movie Details section. I implemented a carousel showcasing various movie names, enhancing the visual experience.

Users can easily filter trending and new movies, providing an up-to-date and personalized viewing experience. The technology stack includes CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionality, Material UI for design components, and React.js for seamless user interactions.

The project was completed in May 2023, showcasing my proficiency in front-end technologies and API integration to create a fully functional and visually appealing movie platform.
